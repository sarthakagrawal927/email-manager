## ADR-001 — In-browser ONNX inference via Transformers.js (not server-side)

**Date:** 2026-04-02 (first commit of `src/lib/embeddings.ts`)
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Run `@huggingface/transformers` (ONNX runtime, WASM backend) in the browser via a `"use client"` component. No server-side ML.

**Alternatives:**
- Server-side inference (CF Workers AI, dedicated ML API)
- Hybrid: embed on first fetch, cache in D1

**Rationale:**
- Privacy-by-design: email text never leaves the browser. Aligns with the core "no server-side email storage" promise.
- Zero inference cost (no tokens/API calls per user).
- CF Workers has a 1 MB gzip bundle limit and no native module support — `onnxruntime-node` and native `.node` binaries cannot run in a Worker at all.

**Tradeoffs:**
- First embedding run downloads the ONNX model (~23 MB for `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) from HuggingFace CDN.
- WASM SIMD is not available on all mobile devices; single-threaded execution on older clients.
- Model must be stubbed out on the server side (webpack alias `@huggingface/transformers: false` + `serverExternalPackages`), requiring a custom OpenNext patch.

**Key files:** `src/lib/embeddings.ts`. (Historically required `next.config.ts` webpack aliases + `patches/opennext-cloudflare-externals.js` to keep ONNX out of the OpenNext server bundle — no longer needed after the 2026-06-20 Vite SPA migration; Vite handles client-only imports natively.)

## ADR-002 — Model selection: `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` at `fp32`

**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for feature-extraction via `pipeline("feature-extraction", ..., { dtype: "fp32" })`. Normalize output to enable cosine similarity via dot product.

**Alternatives:**
- Larger models (e.g. `Xenova/all-mpnet-base-v2`): better recall, ~4× larger download.
- Quantized (`int8`, `q4`): smaller and faster, quality penalty unknown.

**Rationale:**
- MiniLM-L6 is the canonical small-but-capable semantic search model; widely used in Transformers.js examples.
- `fp32` chosen for reliability (quantized WASM paths had reported accuracy regressions at the time).
- TBD: capture exact rationale for fp32 over int8 beyond initial prototyping choice.

**Tradeoffs:**
- 384-dim output stored per email in IndexedDB. At 10k emails ≈ 15 MB of float32 vectors in browser storage.

**Key files:** `src/lib/embeddings.ts`

## ADR-003 — IndexedDB as primary email store (not server DB)

**Date:** 2026-02-24 (initial commit)
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Email metadata, bodies, and embeddings are cached exclusively in browser IndexedDB (`idb` wrapper, `email-search` DB v2 — `emails` store plus a `meta` store for the sync cursor). The server (CF Workers + D1) stores only auth tables.

**Alternatives:**
- Store emails in D1: would require server-side Gmail fetch, indexing, and data-at-rest compliance.
- No local cache: fetch from Gmail API on every page load, hitting rate limits quickly.

**Rationale:**
- Single strongest privacy guarantee: if the server is breached, no mailbox data leaks.
- Avoids GDPR/CCPA storage obligations for email content.
- Gmail API rate limits (429) make uncached fetching impractical for analytics over large inboxes.
- LocalStorage is too small for email bodies; IndexedDB handles tens of thousands of records.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Data does not survive clearing browser storage. No multi-device access.
- No server-side search; all querying happens on the client over fetched data.
- Embeddings are reproducible but re-generating them on a new device takes CPU time.

**Key files:** `src/lib/db.ts`, `README.md` (Privacy Model section)

## ADR-004 — Cloudflare Workers + D1 for the auth/metadata tier

**Date:** 2026-04-25 (CF Workers migration)
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Deploy on Cloudflare Workers. Use CF D1 (`email-manager-auth`) for better-auth session/account tables only. (Originally via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (OpenNext); migrated to Vite SPA + Hono Worker on 2026-06-20 — see [`../knowledge/failed-approaches/2026-06-20-opennext-build-pipeline.md`](../knowledge/failed-approaches/2026-06-20-opennext-build-pipeline.md).)

**Alternatives:**
- Vercel (default Next.js target): easier deploys, no OpenNext needed.
- CF Pages (tried briefly, 2026-04-25): Pages does not support arbitrary Workers runtime; reverted to Workers within the same day.

**Rationale:**
- CF Workers global edge network; latency-sensitive OAuth redirects and Gmail proxy calls.
- D1 is co-located with the Worker, minimizing auth round-trip on session lookup.
- Smart Placement (`[placement] mode = "smart"`) further reduces D1 latency.
- CF free tier covers this app's scale.

**Tradeoffs:**
- OpenNext adds significant build complexity (see ADR-007).
- Worker bundle size limit (1 MB compressed) forces careful exclusion of native modules.
- D1 row/storage limits are generous for auth-only use; would constrain server-side email storage if ever attempted.

**Key files:** `wrangler.toml`, `src/worker.ts` (Hono Worker entry; replaced `worker.mjs` + `open-next.config.ts` on 2026-06-20)

## ADR-005 — better-auth with Google OAuth (not NextAuth)

**Date:** 2026-04-25 (migration commit)
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use `better-auth` with the `drizzleAdapter` pointing at D1. Replaced NextAuth.js.

**Alternatives:**
- NextAuth.js v4 (original): bypassed OIDC discovery step broke on CF Workers edge runtime.
- NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js): TBD: rationale for not upgrading instead of migrating.
- Roll own session management: excessive complexity.

**Rationale:**
- NextAuth's OIDC discovery (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) fetch failed on CF Workers at initial setup; a fix was attempted (`bypass OIDC discovery`) but fragile.
- `better-auth` provides a Drizzle adapter that integrates cleanly with D1; has first-class offline-access/refresh-token support needed for Gmail.
- `accessType: "offline"` + `prompt: "consent"` ensures a refresh token is issued, enabling `auth.api.getAccessToken` to transparently renew expired tokens.

**Tradeoffs:**
- `better-auth` is younger than NextAuth; smaller community.
- Auth env is a dual-lookup pattern (`env[key] ?? process.env[key]`) to support both CF Workers bindings and local Next.js dev.

**Key files:** `src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/lib/get-access-token.ts`, `src/db/schema.ts`, `migrations/0001_better_auth.sql`

## ADR-006 — Drizzle ORM for D1 schema management

**Date:** 2026-04-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use `drizzle-orm` with `drizzle-orm/d1` driver. Schema defined in `src/db/schema.ts`; migrations in `migrations/`.

**Alternatives:**
- Raw D1 SQL: simpler, no dependency, but no type safety.
- Prisma: no D1 adapter at the time; requires prisma-client which cannot bundle in Workers.

**Rationale:**
- better-auth's `drizzleAdapter` requires Drizzle; it was already a forced dependency.
- Typed schema catches column/type drift at build time.

**Tradeoffs:**
- D1 schema is auth-only (4 tables). Drizzle overhead is minimal for this surface.
- `@libsql/client` listed as a dependency despite not being used for D1 access; likely a transitive requirement from better-auth or residual from an earlier libSQL migration path. TBD: verify if removable.

**Key files:** `src/db/schema.ts`, `migrations/0001_better_auth.sql`, `src/lib/auth.ts`

## ADR-007 — OpenNext + custom worker entry + Beasties build pipeline

**Date:** 2026-04-25 through 2026-06-04 (iterative)
**Status:** Superseded (2026-06-20 De-OpenNext migration — see [`../knowledge/failed-approaches/2026-06-20-opennext-build-pipeline.md`](../knowledge/failed-approaches/2026-06-20-opennext-build-pipeline.md)). Kept for historical context.

**Decision:** Use `@opennextjs/cloudflare` to adapt the Next.js build for Workers. Wrap the generated worker in a custom `worker.mjs` that handles edge caching for `/`. Run Beasties (critical-CSS inlining) post-build, before the OpenNext `--skipNextBuild` pass.

**Alternatives:**
- Use OpenNext directly without a custom worker entry: no edge cache for `/`, higher TTFB.
- Use CF Pages Functions: tried and reverted (2026-04-25); Pages runtime constraints don't support the required Worker APIs.

**Rationale:**
- `caches.default` in a custom worker entry avoids needing CF Cache Rules (zone-level configuration) for edge caching.
- Beasties inlines above-the-fold CSS, improving LCP. Must run before `--skipNextBuild` so OpenNext serves the modified HTML (via `staticAssetsIncrementalCache`).
- `overlay-astro-landing.mjs` replaces the OpenNext-rendered `/` with a pre-built Astro static page for ~30ms TTFB vs ~250ms from the Next.js SSR path.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Complex multi-step build: patch → next build → Beasties → OpenNext `--skipNextBuild` → populateCache → Astro build → overlay. Any step failure is opaque.
- The `patches/opennext-cloudflare-externals.js` script patches OpenNext's internal `bundle-server.js` and must be re-checked on OpenNext upgrades.
- The `scripts/cf-build.mjs` workaround (copy full Next.js dist into `.next/node_modules/.pnpm` store) is required because pnpm sparse installs drop files that OpenNext's esbuild needs.

**Key files:** `worker.mjs` (removed), `open-next.config.ts` (removed), `scripts/cf-build.mjs` (removed), `scripts/inline-critical-css.mjs` (removed), `scripts/overlay-astro-landing.mjs` (removed), `patches/opennext-cloudflare-externals.js` (removed). All removed in the 2026-06-20 De-OpenNext migration to Vite SPA + Hono worker.

## ADR-008 — Gmail proxy through API routes (not direct client fetch)

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** All Gmail API calls go through Worker API routes (`/api/emails`, `/api/emails/:id`) that hold the access token server-side. The browser never receives the OAuth access token. (Originally Next.js API routes; migrated to Hono Worker routes on 2026-06-20.)

**Alternatives:**
- Client-side Gmail fetch with token passed to the browser: simpler, but leaks the token to JS.

**Rationale:**
- Access token and refresh token stay in D1 / server memory only.
- Rate-limit retry logic (exponential backoff on 429) lives in `src/lib/gmail.ts` on the server, reducing complexity on the client.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Every Gmail fetch adds one server round-trip (client → CF Worker → Gmail API → client). On cold start this adds latency.

**Key files:** `src/lib/gmail.ts`, `src/worker.ts` (Hono routes for `/api/emails`, `/api/emails/:id`)

## ADR-009 — Sync strategy: pull-on-demand, no background sync

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Emails are fetched from Gmail on user action (page load, scroll, explicit search). There is no background sync, no cron, and no push from Gmail (no Pub/Sub watch).

**Alternatives:**
- Gmail Pub/Sub push notifications: real-time inbox updates; requires server-side state and a writable webhook endpoint.
- Periodic background sync (Service Worker): more complex, requires `gmail.readonly` to remain valid in background.

**Rationale:**
- Keeps the app stateless on the server — no sync state to manage.
- Gmail Pub/Sub requires a topic subscription and `gmail.modify` or topic management scopes outside the read-only model.
- IndexedDB cache means repeat page loads are fast without re-fetching.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Inbox is only as fresh as the last manual load. New mail is not surfaced in real time.
- Large inboxes require multiple explicit "load more" actions before analytics/digest have enough data.
