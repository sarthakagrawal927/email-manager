# Development

Development workflows, testing strategy, and quality gates for email-manager.

## Files

- [`workflows.md`](workflows.md) — local dev, build, test, deploy workflows;
  environment setup; secrets.
- [`testing.md`](testing.md) — testing strategy: unit (Vitest), e2e (Playwright),
  digest fixture verification; what is and is not covered by CI.
