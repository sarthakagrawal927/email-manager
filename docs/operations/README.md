# Operations

How email-manager is deployed, configured, and operated. For executable
scripts, see [`../../scripts/`](../../scripts/) — these docs are the
human-readable companion.

## Files

- [`deployment.md`](deployment.md) — deploy model, Cloudflare Worker config,
  env vars, D1 binding, custom domain.
- [`foundry-evidence.md`](foundry-evidence.md) — privacy-safe build/sync/auth
  evidence for the Foundry.
- [`jobs/`](jobs/) — catalog of scheduled jobs (CI, weekly quality, foundry
  evidence, deploy).
- [`runbooks/`](runbooks/) — step-by-step runbooks (local dev, OAuth setup,
  digest verify, deploy).

## Key operational commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm deploy` | Build + `wrangler deploy` to Cloudflare Workers |
| `pnpm build` | Vite build + Astro landing overlay → `dist/` |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TS check (app + worker) |
| `pnpm test` | Unit tests (Vitest) |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | E2E tests (Playwright) |
| `pnpm digest:verify` | Golden-file digest fixture check |
| `pnpm check:docs` | Validate docs/ (broken links, empty docs, required files) |
