/**
 * Owner-facing analytics — the fixed 4-event taxonomy.
 *
 * Every project in the fleet emits exactly these four events — `signup`,
 * `activated`, `core_action`, `returned` — so a single PostHog project can
 * build one cross-fleet funnel (signup -> activated -> core_action) and a
 * D1/D7 retention insight, with no custom dashboard.
 *
 * Every event carries `project_id: "email-manager"`. This wrapper is intentionally
 * thin so it can later be folded into `posthog-js`.
 *
 * email-manager is an entirely client-side SPA (no server inbox DB), so this
 * module only needs the browser path. It routes through
 * `posthog-js` (`track`), which is initialized by
 * `installBrowserMonitoring()` in `foundry-monitoring.ts`.
